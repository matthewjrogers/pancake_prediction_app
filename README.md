# pancake_prediction_app
My household has a recipe title 'probably pancakes'--so that no one else has to live in crushing uncertainty, this app houses a machine learning model that predicts whether the input ingredients are pancakes or not pancakes. You can interact with a hosted version [at this link.](https://matthew-rogers.shinyapps.io/ProbablyPancakes/?_ga=2.188771437.714062431.1600715482-2092461150.1600715482)

The data collection and modeling scripts for this project are also [available on my GitHub](https://github.com/matthewjrogers/Pancake_ID).
